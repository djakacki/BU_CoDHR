            <p>
               <persName>Harry</persName> woke early the next <date ref="#time">morning</date>.
               Although he could tell it was <date ref="#time">daylight</date>, he kept his
                  <objectName ref="#anatomy">eyes</objectName> shut tight. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“It was a dream,"</quote> he told himself firmly. <quote>“I dreamed a
                     <roleName>giant</roleName> called <persName>Hagrid</persName> came to tell me I
                  was going to a <orgName>school</orgName> for <orgName>wizards</orgName>. When I

            </p>

            <p> There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. </p>

            <p> And there’s <roleName ref="Petunia">Aunt</roleName>
               <persName>Petunia</persName> knocking on the <objectName>door</objectName>,
                  <persName>Harry</persName> thought, his <objectName type="anatomy"
                  >heart</objectName> sinking. But he still didn’t open his <objectName
                  type="anatomy">eyes</objectName>. It had been such a good dream. </p>

            <p> Tap. Tap. Tap. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“All right,”</quote>
               <persName>Harry</persName> mumbled, “I’m getting up.” </p>

            <p> He sat up and <persName>Hagrid</persName>’s heavy <objectName type="clothing"
                  >coat</objectName> fell off him. The <placeName>hut</placeName> was full of
               sunlight, the storm was over, <persName>Hagrid</persName> himself was asleep on the
               collapsed <placeName>sofa</placeName>, and there was an <roleName type="messenger"
                  >owl</roleName> rapping its <objectName type="anatomy">claw</objectName> on the
                  <placeName>window</placeName>, a <objectName>newspaper</objectName> held in its
                  <placeName>beak</placeName>. </p>

            <p>
               <persName>Harry</persName> scrambled to his <placeName type="bodily"
               >feet</placeName>, so happy he felt as though a large
                  <objectName>balloon</objectName> was swelling inside him. He went straight to the
                  <placeName>window</placeName> and jerked it open. The <roleName type="messenger"
                  >owl</roleName> swooped in and dropped the <objectName>newspaper</objectName> on
               top of <persName>Hagrid</persName>, who didn’t wake up. The <roleName
                  type="messenger">owl</roleName> then fluttered onto the
                  <placeName>floor</placeName> and began to attack <persName>Hagrid</persName>’s
                  <objectName type="clothing">coat</objectName>. </p>

            <p>

            </p>

            <p>
               <persName>Harry</persName> tried to wave the <roleName type="messenger"
                  >owl</roleName> out of the way, but it snapped its <objectName type="anatomy"
                  >beak</objectName> fiercely at him and carried on savaging the <objectName
                  type="clothing">coat</objectName>. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“<persName>Hagrid</persName>!”</quote> said <persName>Harry</persName> loudly.
                  <quote>“There’s an <roleName type="messenger">owl</roleName> —”</quote>
            </p>

               <quote>“Pay him,”</quote>
               <persName>Hagrid</persName> grunted into the <objectName>sofa</objectName>. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“What?”</quote>

            <p>
               <persName>Hagrid</persName>’s <objectName type="clothing">coat</objectName> seemed to
               be made of nothing but pockets — bunches of <objectName>keys</objectName>,
                  <objectName>slug pellets</objectName>, balls of <objectName>string</objectName>,
                  <objectName>peppermint humbugs</objectName>, <objectName>teabags</objectName> …
               finally, <persName>Harry</persName> pulled out a handful of strange-looking
                  <objectName type="currency">coins</objectName>. </p>

               <quote>“Give him five <objectName type="currency" n="5">Knuts</objectName>,”</quote>

            </p>

            <p>
               <persName>Harry</persName> counted out five little bronze <objectName type="currency"
                  n="5">coins</objectName>, and the owl held out his leg so
                  <persName>Harry</persName> could put the <objectName type="currency"
                  >money</objectName> into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off
               through the open window. </p>

            <p>
               <persName>Hagrid</persName> yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“Best be off, <persName>Harry</persName>, lots ter do <date type="general"

            <p>
               <persName>Harry</persName> was turning over the wizard <objectName type="currency"
                  ref="wizard">coins</objectName> and looking at them. He had just thought of
               something that made him feel as though the happy <objectName>balloon</objectName>
               inside him had got a puncture. </p>

               the sunlight. The <objectName type="transportation">boat</objectName>
               <roleName type="Vernon">Uncle</roleName>
               <persName>Vernon</persName> had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the

               <persName>Harry</persName> asked, looking around for another <objectName

               <quote>“Flew,”</quote> said <persName>Hagrid</persName>. </p>

            </p>

            <p> They settled down in the <placeName>boat</placeName>, <persName>Harry</persName>
               still staring at <persName>Hagrid</persName>, trying to imagine him flying. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“Seems a shame ter row, though,”</quote> said <persName>Hagrid</persName>,
               giving <persName>Harry</persName> another of his sideways looks. <quote>“If I was ter

               <quote>“Of course not,”</quote> said <persName>Harry</persName>, eager to see more
               magic. <persName>Hagrid</persName> pulled out the pink
                  <objectName>umbrella</objectName> again, tapped it twice on the side of the
                  <placeName>boat</placeName>, and they sped off toward <placeName>land</placeName>. </p>

               <persName>Harry</persName> asked. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“Spells — enchantments,”</quote> said <persName>Hagrid</persName>, unfolding
               his <objectName>newspaper</objectName> as he spoke. <quote>“They say there’s

            <p>
               <persName>Harry</persName> sat and thought about this while
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> read his <objectName>newspaper</objectName>, the Daily

                  >Uncle</roleName>
               <persName>Vernon</persName> that people liked to be left alone while they did this,
               but it was very difficult, he’d never had so many questions in his life. </p>

            <p> At this moment the <objectName type="transportation">boat</objectName> bumped gently

            <p> Passersby stared a lot at <persName>Hagrid</persName> as they walked through the

                  <persName>Harry</persName> couldn’t blame them. Not only was
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at
               perfectly ordinary things like <objectName>parking meters</objectName> and saying
               loudly, <quote>“See that, <persName>Harry</persName>? Things these
                     <roleName>Muggles</roleName> dream up, eh?”</quote>

            <p>
               <quote>“<persName>Hagrid</persName>,”</quote> said <persName>Harry</persName>,
               panting a bit as he ran to keep up, <quote>“did you say there are dragons at
                  Gringotts?”</quote>
            </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“Well, so they say,”</quote> said <persName>Hagrid</persName>. “Crikey, I’d
               like a <objectName type="mythical-being">dragon</objectName>.” </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“You’d like one?”</quote>

            </p>

            <p> They had reached the <placeName>station</placeName>. There was a <objectName
                  type="transportation">train</objectName> to <placeName>London</placeName> in five
                  <date type="time" n="5">minutes</date>’ time. <persName>Hagrid</persName>, who
               didn’t understand <quote>“<orgName>Muggle</orgName>
                  <objectName type="currency" ref="Muggle">money</objectName>,”</quote> as he called
               it, gave the <objectName type="currcncy" ref="money">bills</objectName> to
                  <persName>Harry</persName> so he could buy their <objectName>tickets</objectName>. </p>

            <p> People stared more than ever on the <placeName>train</placeName>.
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> took up two <objectName n="2">seats</objectName> and
               sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus <objectName>tent</objectName>. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“Still got yer <objectName>letter</objectName>,

               <persName>Harry</persName> took the parchment <objectName>envelope</objectName> out

               <quote>“If yeh know where to go,”</quote> said <persName>Hagrid</persName>. </p>

            <p>
               <persName>Harry</persName> had never been to <placeName>London</placeName> before.
               Although <persName>Hagrid</persName> seemed to know where he was going, he was
               obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the
                  <placeName>ticket barrier</placeName> on the <placeName>Underground</placeName>,
               and complained loudly that the <objectName>seats</objectName> were too small and the
                  <objectName type="transportation">trains</objectName> too slow. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“I don’t know how the <orgName>Muggles</orgName> manage without
                  magic,”</quote> he said as they climbed a broken-down <objectName
                  type="transportation">escalator</objectName> that led up to a bustling
                  <placeName>road</placeName> lined with <placeName>shops</placeName>. </p>

            <p>
               <persName>Hagrid</persName> was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all
                  <persName>Harry</persName> had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book
                  <placeName>shops</placeName> and music <placeName>stores</placeName>, hamburger
                  <placeName>restaurants</placeName> and <placeName>cinemas</placeName>, but nowhere
               that looked as if it could sell you a magic <objectName>wand</objectName>. This was
               just an ordinary <placeName>street</placeName> full of ordinary people. Could there
               really be piles of wizard <objectName type="currency" ref="wizard">gold</objectName>
               buried miles beneath them? Were there really <placeName>shops</placeName> that sold
               spell <objectName>books</objectName> and <objectName>broomsticks</objectName>? Might
               this not all be some huge joke that the <orgName>Dursleys</orgName> had cooked up? If
                  <persName>Harry</persName> hadn’t known that the <orgName>Dursleys</orgName> had
               no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> had told him so far was unbelievable,
                  <persName>Harry</persName> couldn’t help trusting him. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“This is it,”</quote> said <persName>Hagrid</persName>, coming to a halt,
                  <quote>“the <placeName>Leaky Cauldron</placeName>. It’s a famous place.”</quote>
            </p>

            <p> It was a tiny, grubby-looking <placeName>pub</placeName>. If
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> hadn’t pointed it out, <persName>Harry</persName>
               wouldn’t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it. Their
                  <objectName type="anatomy">eyes</objectName> slid from the big book <placeName
                  ref="book">shop</placeName> on one side to the record <placeName ref="record"
                  >shop</placeName> on the other as if they couldn’t see the <placeName>Leaky
                  Cauldron</placeName> at all. In fact, <persName>Harry</persName> had the most
               peculiar feeling that only he and <persName>Hagrid</persName> could see it. Before he
               could mention this, <persName>Hagrid</persName> had steered him inside. </p>

            <p> For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a
                  <placeName ref="Leaky Cauldron">corner</placeName>, drinking tiny
                  <objectName>glasses</objectName> of sherry. One of them was smoking a long
                  <objectName>pipe</objectName>. A little man in a <objectName type="clothing">top
                  hat</objectName> was talking to the old <persName>bartender</persName>, who was
               quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when
               they walked in. Everyone seemed to know <persName>Hagrid</persName>; they waved and
               smiled at him, and the <persName>bartender</persName> reached for a
                  <objectName>glass</objectName>, saying, <quote>“The usual,
                     <persName>Hagrid</persName>?”</quote>
            </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“Can’t, <persName>Tom</persName>, I’m on <orgName>Hogwarts</orgName>
                  business,”</quote> said <persName>Hagrid</persName>, clapping his great
                  <objectName type="anatomy">hand</objectName> on <persName>Harry</persName>’s
                  <objectName type="anatomy">shoulder</objectName> and making
                  <persName>Harry</persName>’s <objectName type="anatomy">knees</objectName> buckle. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“Good Lord,”</quote> said the <persName>bartender</persName>, peering at
                  <persName>Harry</persName>, <quote>“is this — can this be — ?”</quote>
            </p>

            <p> The <placeName>Leaky Cauldron</placeName> had suddenly gone completely still and
               silent. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“Bless my soul,”</quote> whispered the old <persName>bartender</persName>,
                     <quote>“<persName>Harry Potter</persName> … what an honor.”</quote>
            </p>

            <p> He hurried out from behind the <placeName>bar</placeName>, rushed toward
                  <persName>Harry</persName> and seized his <objectName type="anatomy"
                  >hand</objectName>, tears in his <objectName type="anatomy">eyes</objectName>. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“Welcome back, Mr. <persName>Potter</persName>, welcome back.”</quote>
            </p>

            <p>
               <persName>Harry</persName> didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The
               old woman with the <objectName>pipe</objectName> was puffing on it without realizing
               it had gone out. <persName>Hagrid</persName> was beaming. </p>

            <p> Then there was a great scraping of <objectName>chairs</objectName> and the next
               moment, <persName>Harry</persName> found himself shaking <objectName type="anatomy"
                  >hands</objectName> with everyone in the <placeName>Leaky Cauldron</placeName>. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“<persName>Doris Crockford</persName>, Mr. <persName>Potter</persName>, can’t
                  believe I’m meeting you at last.”</quote>
            </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“So proud, Mr. <persName>Potter</persName>, I’m just so proud.”</quote>
            </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“Always wanted to shake your <objectName type="anatomy">hand</objectName> —
                  I’m all of a flutter.”</quote>
            </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“Delighted, Mr. <persName>Potter</persName>, just can’t tell you,
                     <persName>Diggle</persName>’s the name, <persName>Dedalus
                  Diggle</persName>.”</quote>
            </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“I’ve seen you before!”</quote> said <persName>Harry</persName>, as
                  <persName>Dedalus Diggle</persName>’s <objectName type="clothing">top
                  hat</objectName> fell off in his excitement. <quote>“You bowed to me once in a
                  shop.”</quote>
            </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“He remembers!”</quote> cried <persName>Dedalus Diggle</persName>, looking
               around at everyone. <quote>“Did you hear that? He remembers me!”</quote>
            </p>

            <p>
               <persName>Harry</persName> shook <objectName type="anatomy">hands</objectName> again
               and again — <persName>Doris Crockford</persName> kept coming back for more. </p>

            <p> A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his <objectName
                  type="anatomy">eyes</objectName> was twitching. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“<persName>Professor Quirrell</persName>!”</quote> said
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName>. <quote>“<persName>Harry</persName>,

            <p>

               <quote>“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,”</quote> muttered <persName>Professor
                  Quirrell</persName>, as though he’d rather not think about it. <quote>“N-not that
                  you n-need it, eh, P-P-<persName>Potter</persName>?”</quote> He laughed nervously.
                  <quote>“You’ll be g-getting all your <objectName>equipment</objectName>, I

            <p> But the others wouldn’t let <persName>Professor Quirrell</persName> keep
                  <persName>Harry</persName> to himself. It took almost ten <date type="time" n="10"
                  >minutes</date> to get away from them all. At last, <persName>Hagrid</persName>
               managed to make himself heard over the babble. </p>

                  type="anatomy">head</objectName> was swimming. <persName>Hagrid</persName>,
               meanwhile, was counting <objectName>bricks</objectName> in the

            <p> He tapped the <placeName>wall</placeName> three times with the point of his

            <p> The <objectName>brick</objectName> he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the
               middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were
               facing an <placeName>archway</placeName> large enough even for
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName>, an <placeName>archway</placeName> onto a cobbled
                  <placeName>street</placeName> that twisted and turned out of sight. </p>

            <p> He grinned at <persName>Harry</persName>’s amazement. They stepped through the
                  <placeName>archway</placeName>. <persName>Harry</persName> looked quickly over his
               shoulder and saw the <placeName>archway</placeName> shrink instantly back into solid
                  <objectName>wall</objectName>. </p>

            <p> The <objectName>sun</objectName> shone brightly on a stack of
                  <objectName>cauldrons</objectName> outside the nearest

               <persName>Harry</persName> wished he had about eight more <objectName type="anatomy"

                  >head</objectName> in every direction as they walked up the
                  <placeName>street</placeName>, trying to look at everything at once: the
                  <placeName>shops</placeName>, the things outside them, the people doing their
               shopping. A plump woman outside an <placeName>Apothecary</placeName> was shaking her
                  <objectName type="anatomy">head</objectName> as they passed, saying,

            <p> A low, soft hooting came from a dark <placeName>shop</placeName> with a sign saying
                  <placeName>Eeylops Owl Emporium</placeName> — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and
               Snowy. Several boys of about <persName>Harry</persName>’s age had their <objectName

               <persName>Harry</persName> heard one of them say, <quote>“the new <objectName

               There were <orgName>shops</orgName> selling <objectName>robes</objectName>,

            <p> They had reached a snowy white <placeName>building</placeName> that towered over the
               other little <objectName>shops</objectName>. Standing beside its burnished bronze
                  <placeName>doors</placeName>, wearing a <objectName>uniform</objectName> of
               scarlet and gold, was — </p>

               <quote>“Yeah, that’s a <roleName>goblin</roleName>,”</quote> said
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> quietly as they walked up the white stone
                  <placeName>steps</placeName> toward him. The <roleName>goblin</roleName> was about
               a <objectName type="anatomy">head</objectName> shorter than
                  <persName>Harry</persName>. He had a swarthy, clever <objectName type="anatomy"
                  >face</objectName>, a pointed beard and, <persName>Harry</persName> noticed, very
               long <objectName type="anatomy">fingers</objectName> and <objectName type="anatomy"
                  >feet</objectName>. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second
               pair of <placeName>doors</placeName>, silver this time, with words engraved upon
               them: </p>

            <p>
               <l> Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who
                  take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn. So if you seek beneath
                  our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of
                  finding more than treasure there. </l>

            <p>
               <quote>“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,”</quote> said
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName>. </p>

            <p> A pair of <roleName>goblins</roleName> bowed them through the silver
                  <placeName>doors</placeName> and they were in a vast marble
                  <placeName>hall</placeName>. About a hundred more <orgName>goblins</orgName> were
               sitting on high <placeName>stools</placeName> behind a long
                  <placeName>counter</placeName>, scribbling in large
                  <objectName>ledgers</objectName>, weighing <objectName type="currency"
                  >coins</objectName> in brass <objectName>scales</objectName>, examining precious
                  <objectName>stones</objectName> through <objectName>eyeglasses</objectName>. There
               were too many <objectName>doors</objectName> to count leading off the
                  <placeName>hall</placeName>, and yet more <roleName>goblins</roleName> were
               showing people in and out of these. <persName>Hagrid</persName> and
                  <persName>Harry</persName> made for the <placeName>counter</placeName>. </p>

               <quote>“Got it here somewhere,”</quote> said <persName>Hagrid</persName>, and he
               started emptying his pockets onto the <placeName>counter</placeName>, scattering a

                  <orgName>goblins</orgName>

            <p> The <roleName>goblin</roleName> looked at it closely. </p>

               <quote>“That seems to be in order.”</quote>

                     <placeName ref="713">vault</placeName> seven hundred and thirteen.”</quote>
            </p>

            <p> The <roleName>goblin</roleName> read the <objectName>letter</objectName> carefully. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“Very well,”</quote> he said, handing it back to <persName>Hagrid</persName>,
                  <quote>“I will have someone take you down to both <placeName>vaults</placeName>.
                     <persName>Griphook</persName>!”</quote>
            </p>

            <p>
               <persName>Griphook</persName> was yet another <roleName>goblin</roleName>. Once
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> had crammed all the <objectName>dog
                  biscuits</objectName> back inside his <placeName>pockets</placeName>, he and
                  <persName>Harry</persName> followed <persName>Griphook</persName> toward one of
               the <placeName>doors</placeName> leading off the <placeName>hall</placeName>. </p>

               <persName>Harry</persName> asked. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“Can’t tell yeh that,”</quote> said <persName>Hagrid</persName> mysteriously.

                     <persName>Dumbledore</persName>’s trusted me. More’n my job’s worth ter tell

            </p>

            <p>
               <persName>Griphook</persName> held the <objectName>door</objectName> open for them.
                  <persName>Harry</persName>, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were
               in a narrow stone <placeName>passageway</placeName> lit with flaming
                  <objectName>torches</objectName>. It sloped steeply downward and there were little
                  <objectName>railway tracks</objectName> on the <placeName>floor</placeName>.
                  <persName>Griphook</persName> whistled and a small <objectName
                  type="transportation">cart</objectName> came hurtling up the
                  <placeName>tracks</placeName> toward them. They climbed in —
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> with some difficulty — and were off. </p>

            <p> At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting
                  <placeName>passages</placeName>. <persName>Harry</persName> tried to remember,
               left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The
               rattling <objectName type="transportation">cart</objectName> seemed to know its own
               way, because <persName>Griphook</persName> wasn’t steering. </p>

            <p>
               <persName>Harry</persName>’s <objectName type="anatomy">eyes</objectName> stung as
               the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a
               burst of fire at the end of a <placeName>passage</placeName> and twisted around to
               see if it was a <objectName type="mythical-being">dragon</objectName>, but too late —
               they plunged even deeper, passing an <placeName>underground lake</placeName> where
               huge <objectName>stalactites</objectName> and <objectName>stalagmites</objectName>
               grew from the <placeName>ceiling</placeName> and <placeName>floor</placeName>. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“I never know,”</quote>
               <persName>Harry</persName> called to <persName>Hagrid</persName> over the noise of
               the <objectName type="transportation">cart</objectName>, <quote>“what’s the
                  difference between a <objectName>stalagmite</objectName> and a

            </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“<objectName>Stalagmite</objectName>’s got an ‘m’ in it,”</quote> said
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName>. <quote>“An’ don’ ask me questions just now, I think
                  I’m gonna be sick.”</quote>
            </p>

            <p> He did look very green, and when the <objectName type="transportation"
                  >cart</objectName> stopped at last beside a small <placeName>door</placeName> in
               the <placeName>passage wall</placeName>, <persName>Hagrid</persName> got out and had
               to lean against the <placeName>wall</placeName> to stop his <objectName
                  type="anatomy">knees</objectName> from trembling. </p>

            <p>
               <persName>Griphook</persName> unlocked the <objectName>door</objectName>. A lot of
               green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, <persName>Harry</persName> gasped.
               Inside were mounds of <objectName type="currency">gold coins</objectName>. Columns of
                  <objectName type="currency">silver</objectName>. Heaps of little bronze
                  <objectName type="currency">Knuts</objectName>. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“All yours,”</quote> smiled <persName>Hagrid</persName>. </p>

            <p> All <persName>Harry</persName>’s — it was incredible. The
                  <orgName>Dursleys</orgName> couldn’t have known about this or they’d have had it
               from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much
                  <persName>Harry</persName> cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a
               small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under <placeName>London</placeName>. </p>

            <p>
               <persName>Hagrid</persName> helped <persName>Harry</persName> pile some of it into a
                  <placeName>bag</placeName>. </p>

               <quote>“The gold ones are <objectName type="currency">Galleons</objectName>,”</quote>
               he explained. <quote>“Seventeen silver <objectName type="currency" n="17"

            <p> They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and

               leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark <placeName ref="ravine"

                  <objectName>telescope</objectName>. Then they visited the
                  <placeName>Apothecary</placeName>, which was fascinating enough to make up for its
               horrible smell, a mixture of bad <objectName>eggs</objectName> and rotted
                  <objectName>cabbages</objectName>. <objectName>Barrels</objectName> of slimy stuff

                  <persName>Harry</persName> himself examined silver <objectName type="anatomy"

            <p> A magic wand … this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. </p>

            <p> The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read
               Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382b.c. A single wand lay on a faded purple
               cushion in the dusty window. </p>

            <p> A tinkling <objectName>bell</objectName> rang somewhere in the depths of the
                  <placeName>shop</placeName> as they stepped <placeName>inside</placeName>. It was
               a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly <objectName>chair</objectName> that
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> sat on to wait. <persName>Harry</persName> felt
               strangely as though he had entered a very strict <placeName>library</placeName>; he
               swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at
               the thousands of narrow <objectName n="1000s">boxes</objectName> piled neatly right
               up to the <placeName>ceiling</placeName>. For some reason, the back of his
                  <objectName type="anatomy">neck</objectName> prickled. The very
                  <objectName>dust</objectName> and silence in here seemed to tingle with some
               secret magic. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“Good afternoon,”</quote> said a soft voice. <persName>Harry</persName>
               jumped. <persName>Hagrid</persName> must have jumped, too, because there was a loud
               crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly <objectName>chair</objectName>. </p>

            <p> An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale <objectName type="anatomy"
                  >eyes</objectName> shining like moons through the gloom of the

               <persName>Mr. Ollivander</persName> had come so close that he and

            <p>
               <quote>“Er — yes, they did, yes,”</quote> said <persName>Hagrid</persName>, shuffling

                  <objectName>light</objectName> on to the <placeName>walls</placeName>.
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> whooped and clapped and <persName>Mr.
                  Ollivander</persName> cried, <quote>“Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well,
                  well, well … how curious … how very curious …”</quote>
            </p>

            <p> He put <persName>Harry</persName>’s <objectName>wand</objectName> back into its
                  <placeName>box</placeName> and wrapped it in brown <objectName>paper</objectName>,
               still muttering, <quote>“Curious … curious …”</quote>
            </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“Sorry,”</quote> said <persName>Harry</persName>, <quote>“but what’s
                  curious?”</quote>
            </p>

            <p>
               <persName>Mr. Ollivander</persName> fixed <persName>Harry</persName> with his pale
               stare. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“I remember every <objectName>wand</objectName> I’ve ever sold, <persName>Mr.
                     Potter</persName>. Every single <objectName>wand</objectName>. It so happens
                  that the <objectName type="mythical-being">phoenix</objectName> whose <objectName

                  one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this
                     <objectName>wand</objectName> when its brother — why, its brother gave you that

            <p>
               <persName>Harry</persName> swallowed. </p>

               <quote>“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half <measure n="13.5">inches</measure>. Yew. Curious
                  indeed how these things happen. The <objectName>wand</objectName> chooses the

                  from you, <persName>Mr. Potter</persName>. … After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named

            </p>

            <p>
               <persName>Harry</persName> shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked <persName>Mr.
                  Ollivander</persName> too much. He paid seven gold <objectName type="currency"
                  n="15">Galleons</objectName> for his <objectName>wand</objectName>, and
                  <persName>Mr. Ollivander</persName> bowed them from his <orgName>shop</orgName>. </p>

            <p> The <date type="time">late afternoon</date>
               <objectName>sun</objectName> hung low in the <placeName>sky</placeName> as
                  <persName>Harry</persName> and <persName>Hagrid</persName> made their way back
               down <placeName>Diagon Alley</placeName>, back through the
                  <placeName>wall</placeName>, back through the <placeName>Leaky
                  Cauldron</placeName>, now empty. <persName>Harry</persName> didn’t speak at all as
               they walked down the <placeName>road</placeName>; he didn’t even notice how much
               people were gawking at them on the <placeName>Underground</placeName>, laden as they
               were with all their funny-shaped <objectName>packages</objectName>, with the
                  <objectName type="animal">snowy owl</objectName> asleep in its
                  <placeName>cage</placeName> on <persName>Harry</persName>’s
                  <placeName>lap</placeName>. Up another <objectName type="transportation"
                  >escalator</objectName>, out into <placeName>Paddington station</placeName>;
                  <persName>Harry</persName> only realized where they were when
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName> tapped him on the <objectName type="anatomy"
                  >shoulder</objectName>. </p>

               <quote>“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer <objectName type="transportation"
                     >train</objectName> leaves,”</quote> he said. </p>

            <p> He bought <persName>Harry</persName> a <objectName>hamburger</objectName> and they
               sat down on plastic <placeName>seats</placeName> to eat them.
                  <persName>Harry</persName> kept looking around. Everything looked so strange,
               somehow. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“You all right, <persName>Harry</persName>? Yer very quiet,”</quote> said
                  <persName>Hagrid</persName>. </p>

            <p>
               <persName>Harry</persName> wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the best
               birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his <objectName>hamburger</objectName>,
               trying to find the words. </p>

            <p>
               <quote>“Everyone thinks I’m special,”</quote> he said at last. <quote>“All those
                  people in the <placeName>Leaky Cauldron</placeName>, <persName>Professor

                  anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I’m famous and I

            </p>

            <p>
               <persName>Hagrid</persName> leaned across the <placeName>table</placeName>. Behind
               the wild <objectName type="anatomy">beard</objectName> and <objectName type="anatomy"
                  >eyebrows</objectName> he wore a very kind smile. </p>

               <persName>Hagrid</persName> helped <persName>Harry</persName> on to the
                  <placeName>train</placeName> that would take him back to the
                  <placeName>Dursleys</placeName>, then handed him an

            <p> The <objectName>train</objectName> pulled out of the <placeName>station</placeName>.
                  <persName>Harry</persName> wanted to watch <persName>Hagrid</persName> until he
